Password: VIP2025
```

### For Waitlist
```
Join the Fansworld waitlist:
cabana.tdstudiosny.com
Be first to know when we launch!
```

## ðŸ“Š Tracking

All interactions are logged in the `waitlist` table:
- Waitlist signups: `source = 'password_landing'`
- Password access: `source = 'password_access'`

## ðŸŽ¨ Quick Customizations

### Change Passwords
Edit `/src/pages/PasswordLanding.tsx`:
```typescript
const VALID_PASSWORDS = [
  // Add or remove passwords here
];
```

### Change Access Duration
Edit `/src/App.tsx`:
```typescript
if (hoursSinceAccess < 24) { // Change 24 to any hours
```

### Update Design
- Background colors in PasswordLanding.tsx
- Animation speeds in the style tag
- Card styling with Tailwind classes

## âš¡ Important Notes

1. **Password Protection is Active** - No one can access the site without a password
2. **Passwords are Case-Insensitive** - VIP2025 = vip2025 = Vip2025
3. **Session-Based** - Closing browser may require re-entry
4. **Mobile Friendly** - Works perfectly on all devices

## ðŸš¨ To Remove Password Protection

If you want to make the site public:
1. Edit `/src/App.tsx`
2. Remove the `PasswordProtectedApp` wrapper
3. Delete the password checking logic
4. Rebuild and deploy

**Your site is now fully password protected and ready for exclusive preview access!**
