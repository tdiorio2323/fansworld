Generated an empty chunk: "stripe-vendor".
[plugin vite:reporter] 
(!) __vite-browser-external:crypto is dynamically imported by /Users/tylerdiorio/CABANA_MASTER_PROJECT/src/lib/security.ts but also statically imported by /Users/tylerdiorio/CABANA_MASTER_PROJECT/src/lib/security.ts, dynamic import will not move module into another chunk.


(!) Some chunks are larger than 600 kB after minification. Consider:
- Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
- Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
- Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.
